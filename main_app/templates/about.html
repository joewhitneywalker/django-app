<h1>About This Application</h1>
<p>This application was built to create an index of characters from one of my favorite novels, Circe by Madeline Miller. This novel is a feminist retelling of Circe, Witch of Aeaea, daughter of Helios and the nymph Perse. Circe first appeared in literature in Homer's Odyssey. </p>
